# Lets get Started

The first thing you will need to do is to download the ISO file for the Manjaro KDE Linux, the ISO file is basically a file containing in it all the Linux Operating system that we will use to install Linux on your device.

## Download the ISO

- Use this [link](https://manjaro.org/downloads/official/kde/) to go to the download page of Manjaro Linux

- Choose either Direct Download or Torrent, whichever works with your internet connection

- After finishing the download, move to the next step

## Boot the ISO

In this step you will create a Boot-able USB drive in order for you to load Linux and start the installation process.

The reason its called boot-able USB, is because the USB will boot (load/ read) its content (the Linux ISO file) on the laptop.

So, for this step you will need the following:

- An empty USB drive that has at least 3GB of space.
- Downloading the Rufus Software from the [Rufus website](https://rufus.ie/en_US/)

Rufus is a Windows tool that will help you create the Boot-able Linux USB drive.

## Steps Summary

- Download the [Manjaro Linux ISO](https://manjaro.org/downloads/official/kde/)
- Download the [Rufus Boot-able USB Drive tool](https://rufus.ie/en_US/)
- Place a USB drive that has more than 3G into your laptop
- Open up Rufus.
